# Cloud Resume API Challenge (Work in Progress)

## Overview
My goal is to create an API-based cloud resume hosted on AWS. This will be store in DynamoDB, and the API will be powered by AWS Lambda. The stack includes Python for Lambda functions, HTML/CSS for the resume interface, and JSON for data storage.

## Prerequisites
Before you begin, make sure you have the following:

1. **Visual Studio Code (VS Code):** For development environment (IDE) for writing and managing your code.
2. **Domain Name:** Purchased or configured domain name for the cloud resume. This will be used to access the resume via a custom URL.
3. **HTML File:** HTML file that represents the resume frontend.
4. **JSON File:** JSON file containing resume data.
5. **Python Code File:** Lambda functions in Python to retrieve data from DynamoDB.
6. **CSS File:** CSS styles code file.
7. **README.md:** Documented project including setup instructions and an overview.
8. **Postman:** Use Postman for testing the API endpoints.
